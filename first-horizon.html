 <p>Almost Breaking News: Appalachian FC announces First Horizon Bank as the
official bank of Bigfoot (or at least his soccer team in the High Country.)</p>
<p>Appalachian Soccer Group LLC is proud to announce First Horizon Bank is the
official bank of Appalachian FC. First Horizon is well known in the High Country
as a bank who deeply cares about itâ€™s community and their support of
Appalachian FC is another example of that community support.</p>
<p>"Any bank that allows me in the lobby is SPECIAL. Their legendary customer
service is why First Horizon is my bank of choice and trust me, I know a thing or
two about LEGENDS." Appalachian FC CMO Bigfoot was overheard yelling from
the tree lines overlooking Ted Mack Soccer Stadium.</p>
<p>First Horizon Bank will be seen at all Appalachian FC home games, on the
popular website www.appalachianfc.com and look for some fun community
promotions from Appalachian FC and First Horizon Bank in 2021.</p>
<p>"First Horizon is honored to be the official bank of the Appalachian Football
Club. It is exciting to think about professional soccer coming to the High
Country and the opportunities having a team in the National Premier
Soccer League brings to our community. This will be a great way for
families who love soccer to watch at the highest level as well as provide
our ASU athletes and students the ability to play, as well as work in the
sports management industry. At First Horizon, part of our mission is to
help our communities be a better place to live and helping bring
professional soccer to the high country will certainly enhance our
community. We invite you to consider joining our family here at First
Horizon and would be honored to become your financial services partner.
On behalf of First Horizon, I believe, and can't wait to attend the first game
of Appalachian FC in May 2021" shared Jason Triplett, Market President -
Northwest NC, First Horizon Bank</p>
<p>On behalf of the Appalachian FC Ownership Group and Front Office, THANK
YOU First Horizon Bank for your support of soccer in the High Country and
sharing our vision for the positive community impact we can have.</p>
<p>For more information about the club, partnerships, NPSL and Season Seats and
hot Appalachian FC Merchandise are available at the official team shop at
www.appalachianfc.com. You can also sign up for our Enewsletter for Squatchy
updates and news.</p>
