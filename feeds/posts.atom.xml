&lt;p&gt;This match was the home opener for the 2024 season and it really got things going for App FC.  Some great performances from Vincent Montoya, Charlie Leech, Elie Bokota, and Niall Reid-Stephens capped off a great night at the Ted Mack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a quite a crowd for the traveling team that came up from Hickory for the match. This is there first season as a club and they'd played a weekend match against Apotheos FC on May 4th which they won 2-0 and put them top of the league with that one match played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feels like a long time since the 2023 season and the Boone fans including the always great Squatch Guard were looking forward to the match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things started off pretty well for App FC who applied great pressure high up the pitch and made it hard for Hickory to get out of their own half.  Every time they tried to go long the returning defenders Rashawn Kellman and Grey Smith mopped things up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first five minutes there was an open net situation when Charlie Walker came out to challenge Hickory FC's number 18.  The Hickory forward was unable to get the ball on target however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the twentieth minute Rashawn Kellmand scored the first goal of the season from an Adam Yousfi free kick.  The free kick was earned by Reid-Stephens after dispossing Hickory almost by the corner flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second goal came from Niall Reid-Stephens from well outside the box.  Just to the left of center beyond the D he blasted one into the bottom left corner for 2-0 Appalachian FC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half finished out with Hickory FC having some spells of possesion and trying to get a clear chance on goal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half was back and forth with App FC pressuring the Hickory goal and Hickory getting more possession than in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a friendly there were quite a few substitutions and it was great to get a look at the whole team during the first match of the season. New to App FC Ken Raghoebar had some great defending throughout the match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning player Tomas De Graauw came on in the second half and really shown with his pressing, passing, and defending. App FC had several shots saved and a couple wide of the target, but in the 91st minute Oskar Ilhen chipped the keeper to make it 3-0 to Appalachian FC right before the final wistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/&amp;lt;VIDEO_ID&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;img alt="link to youtube video of condensed match" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/&amp;lt;VIDEO_ID&amp;gt;/hqdefault.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post Match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This match was also the inaugural Moon Shine Cup.  This competition within the larger league season consists of Appalachian FC, Hickory FC, and Charlottetown Hops FC.  The teams are playing for a jug and bragging rights.  &lt;/p&gt;

Mike is well known around the High Country as a passionate soccer fan, key leader of the Appalachian FC Ownership Group and has been known to make a Bigfoot cameo in the community; well now, you can add Appalachian FC General Manager to that list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Marketing Officer and former self-appointed General Manager Bigfoot roared his thoughts on the news, “I mean I won NPSL General Manager of the Year [App FC Note: Self awarded by Bigfoot and not awarded by NPSL] so you think Appalachian FC would have taken up the option in my contract [App FC Note: There was no option because there was no contract because Bigfoot was not GM]. That said, Mike Raymond is the right man for the job so if you don’t want the world’s most popular cryptid to do it, then you made the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Raymond is a part of the Ownership Group and has played a critical role in the launch and successful operations of Appalachian FC over the first two NPSL Seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC Owner &amp;amp; co-Managing Partner Michael “Hitch” Hitchcock shared, “Appalachian FC is coming off a very successful Sophomore season, on and off the field. Our club has evolved to the point where we need a Full Time General Manager to help lead the club to the next level. While we interviewed many candidates, the right man was already a key leader in the club. Excited for Mike as this is a dream come true for the hardest working person in our Ownership Group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike played Division I college soccer at Jacksonville University where he played right wing. In the High Country, Mike has been very active in the local soccer community at the youth and adult levels. Mike is married to wife, Jamie who have four children; Emma (14), Braxton (11), Marley (9) and Briggs (3) that are all actively involved in High Country soccer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked our new GM a couple of rapid-fire questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favorite soccer moment: “Beating Duke in the first round of the NCAA tournament and speaking to Jay Heaps after the game. Also, App FC winning the conference title in front of our home fans last season was up there as well!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favorite Premier League Team: “Manchester United”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favorite Soccer Player: “Wayne Rooney”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prediction for US performance at 2022 World Cup: “We win the group and make a run to the finals! I BELIEVE!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Appalachian FC General Manager Mike Raymond shared his excitement for this opportunity, “The passion and commitment I had for soccer growing up led me to play at the collegiate level, for a D1 school. I hope to bring that same passion and commitment to this club. This is a position that I consider to be my dream job. I am excited to be a part of continuing the growth of the beautiful game here in the high country!”Jason O’Keefe, former App State Men’s Soccer Coach and current Appalachian FC Owner &amp;amp; co-Managing Partner added, “I am very happy for Mike, and Jamie, to get this first full time role with the club. Mike has dreamed of this day and has told me several times. Now his dream is becoming a reality because he BELIEVED!!!!The Raymond’s have been as hands on as any owner could be. The time and dedication has been instrumental for App FC’s growth and success. The club's future is very bright under the leadership of Mike in the high country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC is preparing for the clubs third season where the club is making plans to participate in the 108th Lamar Hunt US Open Cup and defending the NPSL Southeast Conference Championship.

&lt;p&gt;BOONE, NC - The Boone Area Chamber of Commerce is pleased to announce its winners of the 2021 Watauga County Business of the Year Awards. The winners were unveiled on Thursday, January 20, 2022, during the 6th Annual High Country Economic Kickoff Event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup Business of the Year: Appalachian FC
It took one short walk for a Sasquatch dribbling a soccer ball, and an icon was born. This catchy social media launch of the Appalachian Football Club brought instant notoriety to the startup National Premier Soccer League soccer franchise, and millions of eyeballs focused on the High Country in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The viral video of the brand rollout captured over a million unique views helping to bolster over $200k of merchandise revenue across all 50 states, over half of which was earned before the franchise played its first match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its first season was a success on and off the pitch. A regular season record of 4-2-4 qualified Appalachian FC for the semifinals of the NPSL Southeast Conference playoffs. The team played to an average paid attendance of 1,100 fans at Ted Mackorell Soccer Complex, all made possible thanks to a partnership between Watauga County, Appalachian State University, High Country Soccer, and the Boone Area Sports Commission. Stamping its unique signature on each home match, the Squatch Guard fan group marched through the woods from neighboring Booneshine Brewing Company and took over the center section of Ted Mack, providing the most raucous atmosphere in the league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're humbled and honored by the support of amazing fans and sponsors in the High Country. Our goal was to build a legendary soccer club that everyone in the High Country could be proud to support. The response since Day One has exceeded the BIG expectations of our Chief Marketing Officer and self-appointed General Manager Bigfoot!" shared Appalachian FC Managing Partner, Michael (Hitch) Hitchcock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC worked quickly to establish local partnerships, connecting with over 30 High Country businesses in its initial sponsorship rollout. The franchise teamed with Booneshine Brewing Company to create Squatchy Ale, a seasonal beer that helped bring instant awareness to the team and its neighborhood partner. Booneshine co-owners Tim Herdklotz and Carson Coatney were among over 10 local investors that helped provide stability and recognizable High Country faces to the organization in its formative season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC exceeded its revenue expectations in its first year and quickly vaulted itself to one of the most successful franchises in the NPSL. Since the conclusion of the 2021 season, the team has started the sale of local ownership shares, engaging over 150 fans with the team through a unique investment option, making Appalachian FC the Green Bay Packers of the NPSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While 2021 was a good year, we're excited for 2022 and our Sophomore Season. Appalachian FC has ambitious plans, on the field and in the community, to go from "good to great"; which starts with expanding our Ownership Group with passionate High Country supporters and local leaders. It has been special to see engaged fans become engaged owners. This year is a World Cup year and Appalachian FC is well positioned to help grow the World's Game in the High Country." Hitch added.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category></entry><entry><title>Boone Area Sports Commission joins the Squatchy Sponsorship Family for Historic Season</title><link href="/boone-area-sports-commission.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-03-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Adam Sommer</name></author><id>tag:None,2021-03-30:/boone-area-sports-commission.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Boone, NC - Appalachian FC is humbled and honored that Boone Area Sports Commission has joined the Appalachian FC Sponsorship Family… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC long winded Chief Marketing Officer Bigfoot held a Press Conference outside his nest to enthusiastically share his red hot sports opinions, ”To successfully launch a professional sports team, it takes a village. And we’re lucky to have a village with a dynamic Sports Commission led by innovative leaders, like David Jackson and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roachel Laney.” Bigfoot continued “Sports is such an important part of Boone thanks to their vision and leadership. As a matter of fact, in July 2019, I heard there were Otters down at Ted Mack so I headed down the game trail to, umm, to..., well, I’d rather not share the details of what I was planning to do when I got to the Otters but when I get to the tree line, hear the roar of a crowd and see the Ted Mackorell Soccer Classic featuring semi-pro team Tri-Cities Otters which was hosted by Boone Area Sports Commission. I enjoyed the match from a distance. and needless to say, I was impressed with the passionate High Country soccer fans in attendance. Impressed enough to help bring Appalachian FC to the High Country.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC launched on November 18, 2020 with a video that has received over 250,000 impressions when Bigfoot walked down that same game trail, from his nest to Ted Mack, to check out the stadium and have a kick around. Since the launch, Appalachian FC has built a passionate fan base in the High Country and around the US. Fans in 40 states have purchased Appalachian FC Gear… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boone Area Chamber of Commerce President &amp;amp; CEO David Jackson added, “It has been inspiring to watch and actively participate in the collaboration that has helped bring us all to this point. The ownership of Appalachian FC has been forward thinking about local partnerships and opportunities since the idea for the franchise was first hatched. We have also marveled at the branding power franchise has on a National and International level, and this will only help bring more positive attention to our community as the franchise grows its reach.” David continued, “One of the themes of the last year has centered around our community’s ability to rally around one another, and the good that comes from such action. As we look forward to enjoying pleasant distractions once again, we have a local team we can rally around, that represents the sense of community and partnership High Country residents have long embraced. We are excited to be a part of this inaugural season and can’t wait to see how Appalachian FC grows as we move forward.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigfoot quickly added, “I could not have said that better myself and that’s saying something.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC will proudly represent Boone and the High Country starting this May when the club kicks off the Inaugural Season, playing the top teams and players in the Southeast Region of the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), considered the 4th Tier in the US Soccer Landscape, with Major League Soccer as the 1st Division. First game is Saturday, May 1st in Louisville and the Historic Home Opener vs. Georgia Revolution will be Saturday, May 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boone Area Sports Commission Director Roachel Laney commented, “The High Country will now have it’s own local pro team to rally behind and to pull for. With less restrictions in gatherings being favorable, local soccer fans will be able to attend and hopefully fill the stands at Ted Mackorell Stadium. Thanks to the ownership for their vision and commitment that will allow our community to again be able to come together in a common cause… LET’S GO SQUATCHY!!! I look forward to our community gathering together to show their support for the APPALACHIAN FOOTBALL CLUB.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fans who may not be familiar with the great work that the Boone Area Sports Commission (BASC) does for our community… The BASC is a proud member of the Sports Events and Tourism Association, the premier trade association for the industry in the United States. The Boone and Watauga County Tourism Development Authorities provide a portion of the operational funding to the BASC along with industry contacts that have helped create awareness with event organizers across the State of North Carolina and the Southeast Region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BASC works with a variety of partners and all levels of sport. Our staff connects organizers with event-hosting resources, including hotel and restaurant partners, area attractions, and other services provided by members of the Boone Area Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roachel Laney has served as Boone Area Sports Commission Director since the organization's inception. He works with event representatives and local organizers to recruit new opportunities to the area while also assisting with established events to enhance their operations and impact on the area economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BASC was formed after nearly 18-months of study by local stakeholders, seeking ways to further boost the local tourism economy. Don Shumacher, founder of DSA Sports, LLC, and past President of the National Association of Sports Commissions conducted a comprehensive feasibility study that included an inventory of local sports facilities and amenities, and provided recommendations for growth opportunities in the sports tourism arena. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bigfoot was in a very zen state of mind when he shared his thoughts on the new signings, “Three more ballers have been brought into the nest by Coach Parker. Let me start with a local rising star Neymar; I mean if everyone is calling you Neymar, you must be a PLAYER. Then we have a rock solid defender Diego Gonzalez who has shown his quality at a quality college program. And then we have Dutch midfielder, Thomas who brings something special to the club. Not to mention, I love the Dutch. Every since watching them in the 1994 World Cup in Washington DC where all their fans wore orange wooden shoes that sounded like tree knocks when they walked. I digress, I’m very happy with how the team is coming together.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCING YOUR APPALACHIAN FC PLAYERS [Stats and Quotes Below]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diego Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt;
Diego is a left footed defender who can play multiple roles in the backline and in midfield. During his U16-U19 years, featured in almost every game for VDA in the Development Academy, becoming a sought after player for many colleges in the area. After signing for ODU, Diego has featured in the Monarchs’ back line in his first year with the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach Parker quote- “Diego is a player with exceptional talent. He has ability on the ball, mixed with great desire defensively which makes him a pleasure to work with as a coach. He will give us balance on the left side of defense which will compliment the way we want to play. I’m delighted to be working with him again at this stage of his career.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego quote- "I’m excited to get started with the club and be surrounded by quality players and coaches who will help me in many aspects of my game!" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas de Graauw&lt;/strong&gt;
From Amsterdam, Netherlands, Thomas de Graauw comes to App FC with a stellar background. Thomas is a standout player at Shawnee State where he started all 19 games, contributing 9 goals and 6 assists in his first season (2019). He spent most of his youth career at S.V. Hoofddorp in the 4th tier of Dutch football. He has a reputation for scoring spectacular goals, which we hope to see this season! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach Parker quote- “Thomas will be an important signing for us. His quality on set pieces will give us an edge, and his creativity in the attacking half of the pitch should provide goals and opportunities for others. He is a great character and I’m looking forward to having him in the group.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas quote- "I am excited to be a part of Appalachian FC and I am looking forward to being a part of the family. I am grateful that I have been given the opportunity to take on this adventure and I will give it my everything to achieve great things with the team this summer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edras “Neymar” Sandoval&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another local talent, “Neymar” as he is affectionately know in Boone, is a young forward who stood out at the club’s first tryout on March 6th. Originally from Guatemala, Neymar has been developing his game in the Liga de Futbol Belleza for Hawks United F.C. Fans should expect to see him attacking with flair and passion in his first season with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach Parker quote- “After seeing Neymar at the first tryout, it was obvious to me and the coaching staff that we should give him this opportunity. He will add some flair to the attack and have the ability to change a game when we need a goal. I hope this will be a good platform for him to develop and grow into a top player.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neymar Quote- "Feliz por ser parte del equipo y es una aportunidad que voy aprovechar pienso que cualquiera quisiera estar en un gran equipo cómo esté"
"I am happy to be a part of the team and the opportunity that I will take full advantage of. I think anyone would want to be a part of a great team like this.” &lt;/p&gt;

They will continue to be great role models for the young players in the area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App FC Head Coach Dale Parker stated “As head coach it’s great to sign another group of players that have already represented this community. These guys will be so important to us as we build a solid foundation this year. Camden will hopefully bring goals, Kelvin some excitement going forward and Myson will add some steel to our defensive side of the game. Can’t wait to work with all three of them." Coach Parker shared additional thoughts about the three new signings, “Camden Holbrook - is a prolific attacking player who has already scored big goals at Ted Mac so expecting the same this summer. He is now gaining great experience at Syracuse playing in the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelvin Mulinya is a wide attacking player that’s personality is bigger than life. He will add to our attacking prowess but more importantly light up the high country community with his smile and appreciation for life like he did while at App State.

&lt;p&gt;work hard is infectious, and this was evident for the duration of tryout last week. We are lucky to have a player of his calibre, who is a local guy and knows what this club means to the local soccer fans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin shared his thoughts- “I have been living in Boone for over 12 years, so being a part of Appalachian FC is an honor, and this is just the beginning. I am a local guy, willing to defend, and make this an awesome opportunity for others to have a pathway.

Before joining Atlanta United, Jeremiah played for youth clubs; Chiefs FC &amp;amp; Inter Atlanta FC who both played a critical role in his development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HC Dale Parker added- “I’m delighted to add Jeremiah to the roster for this season. He is an exciting talent and can play in a number of roles in different systems. He is coming from a good program at Georgia Southern, and has played for some great clubs in the youth ranks. Can’t wait to work with him and see what he can accomplish at this level.” 
Jeremiah shared: “I am more than excited to be playing with Appalachian FC this summer. I look forward to meeting everyone on the team and seeing what the future holds for us.” &lt;/p&gt;

He will play a big part this season and the fans can expect to see an all-action defender that will give everything for the club.”

&lt;p&gt;Exciting news echoes through the High Country with the signing of 2018/2019 App State Captain Juan Hernandez, 2019 Sun Belt Defensive Player of the Year Zeiko Harris and Goalkeeper Nick Buchholz &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to say that I’ve been stalking these three guys since our Club Announcement on November 18th but some might loosely define my proactive and somewhat aggressive recruiting of Juan, Zeiko and Nick as stalking but whatever, it worked. We got our guys!” Bigfoot sheepishly commented during a fuzzy zoom call from his nest in the High Country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Former App State players bring tons of experience and leadership to Appalachian FC for the clubs first season. Hernandez and Harris were three year starters for Appalachian State while both were Co-Captains during the 2019 season. Meanwhile, Nick was Redshirted during his Freshman Season in Boone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC Head Coach Dale Parker commented on his first three signings, “I’m delighted to have Zeiko, Juan and Nick back in Boone as part of the first Appalachian FC team. Zeiko will bring quality and experience for us defensively and will be a good role model for some of the younger players. As an exciting attacking player, Juan will give us some creativity and firepower going forward, along with his leadership. Nick is a young goalkeeper and I’m excited to see him push forward and fulfill his potential. As former App State players, these players will know what it means to step on the field at Ted Mack and help connect the other guys to our local fan base." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights from our first Appalachian FC Players… we call this DYK! + Juan was Captain of App State for 2018 and 2019 Seasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zeiko was 2019 Sun Belt Defender of the Year and First Team All Sun Belt + These players Started 99 App State games during 3 years in Boone + Zeiko was selected second team All-South East Region by United Soccer Coaches in 2019 &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former App State Head Coach and Appalachian FC Owner Jason O’Keefe added, “We are very excited to have Nick, Juan and Zieko signing for Appalachian FC this summer. All three are exceptional youngmen with tremendous soccer talents which will be on display in the High Country once again. This means so much to me personally and for this community to have former App State men's soccer players representing us all again. It has come full circle now with these players and this community being able to share in their love for the game of soccer together once again. We are speaking with some other former App State players and hope to add a few more in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s what our first players in club history had to say about coming back to Boone this Summer… &lt;/p&gt;

When the opportunity to play the beautiful game in front of the people of the High Country arose, there was no question in my mind that this would be a memorable experience. To the Owners, Staff and Fans of Appalachian FC, BE READY for an unforgettable season.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Buchholz who now plays at Fordham University shared, “I couldn’t be more excited to come back to the place where my collegiate career started. Boone will always have a special place in my heart and it’s an honor to be representing Appalachian FC in their inaugural season. I had the best year of my life at App State and I can’t wait to be back in the High Country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve watched Dale for many years as an All-American at Lees-McRae, a former NPSL player and now NCAA Coach and he’s got what it takes to lead our team during this Historic first season. My only complaint is that he’s too short, but I say that about everyone we hire who is not 7 feet tall.” Appalachian FC CMO and Soccer Fanatic Bigfoot grunted as he entered the woods above Ted Mack Soccer Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale Parker had an impressive playing career. Originally from England where he played for Worksop Town FC in the 5th Division of English pro soccer. In 2006, Dale moved to the US where he was a Two time All-American for Lees-McRae College. Dale played for Chesterfield United in the NPSL in 2013 &amp;amp; 2014. His experience as a player at many different levels will help him build a successful culture for the Appalachian FC team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Appalachian FC is a club of opportunity for players, executives and coaches. We’re excited to bring an “up &amp;amp; coming coach” in Dale Parker to Boone to lead our club. Dale possesses all the qualities we’re looking for in our first head coach. He has tremendous potential and I BELIEVE that someday we’ll be able to brag about, ‘remember when Dale Parker coached Appalachian FC!’”, Appalachian FC owner Hitch shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dale has extensive coaching experience at all levels of soccer in the US. He’s coached a number of US Youth National Team Players in the US Soccer Developmental Academy. In 2015, he earned his US Soccer Federation Coaching A License which is the highest license in the US. In 2019, Dale joined the NCAA Division II powerhouse Lander University staff as Assistant Coach and in 2020, he became the Head Coach of Lander University Development Team for the number 2 ranked NCAA Division II team in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Head Coach Dale Parker stated, “I'm very honored and excited to be the first ever coach for Appalachian FC. I'd like to thank the ownership group for creating something very unique and special for the High Country, and for putting their trust in me to lead the program on the field. We have an opportunity to bring soccer back to this community and hopefully give local supporters something to cheer for during a time when there has been so much taken away. Our goal will be to put an exciting team on the field that represents what Appalachian FC is all about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC will play in the Southeast Conference with games starting early May. Now the fun task begins of building out the team for the first season. Appalachian FC will announce Tryouts soon to provide opportunity for local players and out town players who want to come into town for tryouts. Together, Jason O’Keefe and Dale Parker will build the roster for the inaugural season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appalachian FC Owner Jason O’Keefe concluded, “We are excited to announce the appointment of Dale Parker as the first head coach of Appalachian FC. The buzz and excitement of our new club has been amazing. This hiring will keep it going as Dale returns to a familiar place. He spent his college days in the high country playing for Lee’s McRae National finalist team in 2009, where he was named a Daktronic DII NCAA All American in 2009 and honorable mention in 2007. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience which will help the club build and develop our team for the inaugural season and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;
