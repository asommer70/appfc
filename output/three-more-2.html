 <p><strong>Boone, NC - More High Country Sports History has been made, with the signing of the first local player to Appalachian FC. High Country Soccer Legend Kevin Arguello is joined by Georgia Southern (and Former Atlanta United Academy) player Jeremiah Luoma and University of Kentucky center back Will Wagner as the next 3 players making High Country Soccer History.</strong></p>
<p>Self appointed General Manager Bigfoot wasted no time to share his excitement, “Kevin is a local legend, trust me, takes one to know one. Jeremiah played in one of the top MLS Academies in the US. Will has European playing experience and a stud Center Back for Kentucky. I mean, if you can not get excited about these three signings, we need to check your pulse.” </p>

<p><strong>Kevin Arguello, Midfielder, Boone NC</strong>
Born and raised in Nicaragua, Kevin has an extensive playing history both domestically and in the United States. At age 14, he represented his U16 Nicaragua National Team and was named most valuable player. After being one of the youngest players to sign professionally at his home club in Nicaragua, Kevin spent 3 years playing professionally before moving to the U.S. Kevin has previous experience in the NPSL, where he represented Gate City FC (Greensboro, NC) in 2014. Kevin is currently a coach in High Country Soccer Association. </p>
<p>Head Coach Dale Parker added - “Kevin is an experienced player who will guide others and be a role model for some of our younger guys. His ability on the ball and desire to</p>
<p>work hard is infectious, and this was evident for the duration of tryout last week. We are lucky to have a player of his calibre, who is a local guy and knows what this club means to the local soccer fans.” </p>
<p>Kevin shared his thoughts- “I have been living in Boone for over 12 years, so being a part of Appalachian FC is an honor, and this is just the beginning. I am a local guy, willing to defend, and make this an awesome opportunity for others to have a pathway. I will give it my all, the question I have for you is will you be there to see and experience our journey? Go App FC!” </p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Luoma, Midfield/Defender, Georgia Southern University</strong>
Jeremiah was born in South Sudan and is the middle child of a family of eleven. Hometown is now Atlanta, where he played for the prestigious Atlanta United Academy (MLS), playing 50 games and scoring 3 goals during U18/19. In 2020, he started every game for GSU. Before joining Atlanta United, Jeremiah played for youth clubs; Chiefs FC &amp; Inter Atlanta FC who both played a critical role in his development. </p>
<p>HC Dale Parker added- “I’m delighted to add Jeremiah to the roster for this season. He is an exciting talent and can play in a number of roles in different systems. He is coming from a good program at Georgia Southern, and has played for some great clubs in the youth ranks. Can’t wait to work with him and see what he can accomplish at this level.” 
Jeremiah shared: “I am more than excited to be playing with Appalachian FC this summer. I look forward to meeting everyone on the team and seeing what the future holds for us.” </p>
<p><strong>Will Wagner, Center Back, University of Kentucky</strong>
Will was a stand-out youth player in the U.S. Development Academy, playing for VDA from U15-U19 before heading to the University of Kentucky in 2019. Will also has overseas playing experience, spending time in Germany, and lining up against the likes of Liverpool and Middlesbrough in the U.K. </p>
<p>HC Dale Parker Added - “Will was an immediate target for me as soon as I was announced as head coach. Having worked with him in the youth ranks, I know his qualities and the potential he has to get to the next level. He will play a big part this season and the fans can expect to see an all-action defender that will give everything for the club.”
Will Wagner shared - “I’m delighted to be a part of Appalachian FC and working with Coach Dale again. I can’t wait to see what the future holds!” </p>
