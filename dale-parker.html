 <p>Somewhere in the High Country, NC - Bigfoot got his man to lead Appalachian FC for the Inaugural Season, when Appalachian FC announced Dale Parker, Lander University Assistant Coach &amp; US Soccer Federation “A” License coach, has joined Appalachian FC as the first coach in club history.</p>
<p>“I’ve watched Dale for many years as an All-American at Lees-McRae, a former NPSL player and now NCAA Coach and he’s got what it takes to lead our team during this Historic first season. My only complaint is that he’s too short, but I say that about everyone we hire who is not 7 feet tall.” Appalachian FC CMO and Soccer Fanatic Bigfoot grunted as he entered the woods above Ted Mack Soccer Stadium.</p>
<p>Dale Parker had an impressive playing career. Originally from England where he played for Worksop Town FC in the 5th Division of English pro soccer. In 2006, Dale moved to the US where he was a Two time All-American for Lees-McRae College. Dale played for Chesterfield United in the NPSL in 2013 &amp; 2014. His experience as a player at many different levels will help him build a successful culture for the Appalachian FC team.</p>
<p>“Appalachian FC is a club of opportunity for players, executives and coaches. We’re excited to bring an “up &amp; coming coach” in Dale Parker to Boone to lead our club. Dale possesses all the qualities we’re looking for in our first head coach. He has tremendous potential and I BELIEVE that someday we’ll be able to brag about, ‘remember when Dale Parker coached Appalachian FC!’”, Appalachian FC owner Hitch shared.</p>
<p>Dale has extensive coaching experience at all levels of soccer in the US. He’s coached a number of US Youth National Team Players in the US Soccer Developmental Academy. In 2015, he earned his US Soccer Federation Coaching A License which is the highest license in the US. In 2019, Dale joined the NCAA Division II powerhouse Lander University staff as Assistant Coach and in 2020, he became the Head Coach of Lander University Development Team for the number 2 ranked NCAA Division II team in the country.</p>
<p>New Head Coach Dale Parker stated, “I'm very honored and excited to be the first ever coach for Appalachian FC. I'd like to thank the ownership group for creating something very unique and special for the High Country, and for putting their trust in me to lead the program on the field. We have an opportunity to bring soccer back to this community and hopefully give local supporters something to cheer for during a time when there has been so much taken away. Our goal will be to put an exciting team on the field that represents what Appalachian FC is all about.”</p>
<p>Appalachian FC will play in the Southeast Conference with games starting early May. Now the fun task begins of building out the team for the first season. Appalachian FC will announce Tryouts soon to provide opportunity for local players and out town players who want to come into town for tryouts. Together, Jason O’Keefe and Dale Parker will build the roster for the inaugural season.</p>
<p>Appalachian FC Owner Jason O’Keefe concluded, “We are excited to announce the appointment of Dale Parker as the first head coach of Appalachian FC. The buzz and excitement of our new club has been amazing. This hiring will keep it going as Dale returns to a familiar place. He spent his college days in the high country playing for Lee’s McRae National finalist team in 2009, where he was named a Daktronic DII NCAA All American in 2009 and honorable mention in 2007. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience which will help the club build and develop our team for the inaugural season and beyond.”</p>
