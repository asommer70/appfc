 <p><strong>Boone, NC - SO it’s REAL, no we don’t mean Bigfoot who we see in our office at least two to three days per week, every week but we’re referring to NPSL Soccer coming to Boone. Today, National Premier Soccer League announced the 2021 Southeast Conference Schedule which includes your Appalachian FC Inaugural Season Schedule.</strong></p>
<p>“I can barely contain my excitement” Appalachian FC Chief Marketing Officer Bigfoot
roared, “We finally have our inaugural season schedule and it looks GREAT. The expansion season is always the toughest, on and off the field, but we have a strong ownership group, great management (yes, I just pointed to myself), quality coaching staff and we’re building a really good team that will proudly represent the High Country and the High Country will be proud to support. Let’s go...”</p>
<p><strong>Appalachian FC will play their first game in club history on the road, May 1st, at Louisville. High Country fans will gather at Boone Saloon for the Official Away Game Viewing Party.

Then what we have all been waiting for... The Historic Home Opener at Ted Mack on Saturday, May 15th 7pm vs. Georgia Revolution. See below for complete schedule.</strong></p>
<p>Head Coach Dale Parker added “It’s a tricky schedule, lots of challenges, but also opportunities for us to test ourselves. It does set up nicely to have a good run with the home games coming in, if we can put some results together. I’m looking forward to getting the team together in April and starting the preparations for May 1st" Season Seats are on sale now.
