 <p><strong>Boone, NC - As High Country sports history continues to be made in advance of the 2021 Inaugural Season, Appalachian FC is proud to announce three Former App State players as the first three players signed in Club History.</strong></p>
<p>Exciting news echoes through the High Country with the signing of 2018/2019 App State Captain Juan Hernandez, 2019 Sun Belt Defensive Player of the Year Zeiko Harris and Goalkeeper Nick Buchholz </p>
<p>“I don’t want to say that I’ve been stalking these three guys since our Club Announcement on November 18th but some might loosely define my proactive and somewhat aggressive recruiting of Juan, Zeiko and Nick as stalking but whatever, it worked. We got our guys!” Bigfoot sheepishly commented during a fuzzy zoom call from his nest in the High Country. </p>
<p>These Former App State players bring tons of experience and leadership to Appalachian FC for the clubs first season. Hernandez and Harris were three year starters for Appalachian State while both were Co-Captains during the 2019 season. Meanwhile, Nick was Redshirted during his Freshman Season in Boone. </p>
<p>Appalachian FC Head Coach Dale Parker commented on his first three signings, “I’m delighted to have Zeiko, Juan and Nick back in Boone as part of the first Appalachian FC team. Zeiko will bring quality and experience for us defensively and will be a good role model for some of the younger players. As an exciting attacking player, Juan will give us some creativity and firepower going forward, along with his leadership. Nick is a young goalkeeper and I’m excited to see him push forward and fulfill his potential. As former App State players, these players will know what it means to step on the field at Ted Mack and help connect the other guys to our local fan base." </p>
<p>Some highlights from our first Appalachian FC Players… we call this DYK! + Juan was Captain of App State for 2018 and 2019 Seasons. </p>
<ul>
<li>Zeiko was 2019 Sun Belt Defender of the Year and First Team All Sun Belt + These players Started 99 App State games during 3 years in Boone + Zeiko was selected second team All-South East Region by United Soccer Coaches in 2019 </li>
<li>Zeiko was also selected First Team All Sun Belt in 2018 </li>
</ul>
<p>Former App State Head Coach and Appalachian FC Owner Jason O’Keefe added, “We are very excited to have Nick, Juan and Zieko signing for Appalachian FC this summer. All three are exceptional youngmen with tremendous soccer talents which will be on display in the High Country once again. This means so much to me personally and for this community to have former App State men's soccer players representing us all again. It has come full circle now with these players and this community being able to share in their love for the game of soccer together once again. We are speaking with some other former App State players and hope to add a few more in the future. </p>
<p>And here’s what our first players in club history had to say about coming back to Boone this Summer… </p>
<p>Zeiko Harris who now plays at University of Louisville shared, “I’m very excited to be back in Boone this upcoming Summer. Boone became my second home and will always have a special place in my heart. Looking forward to joining Appalachian FC in their new journey in the NPSL.”</p>
<p>Juan Hernandez who is finishing his Undergrad Degree at App State added, “I’m ecstatic to be joining Appalachian FC this Summer. When the opportunity to play the beautiful game in front of the people of the High Country arose, there was no question in my mind that this would be a memorable experience. To the Owners, Staff and Fans of Appalachian FC, BE READY for an unforgettable season.” </p>
<p>Nick Buchholz who now plays at Fordham University shared, “I couldn’t be more excited to come back to the place where my collegiate career started. Boone will always have a special place in my heart and it’s an honor to be representing Appalachian FC in their inaugural season. I had the best year of my life at App State and I can’t wait to be back in the High Country.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, March 6th at Ted Mack; Appalachian FC will host our first Open Tryouts when 40 players will bring their A Game to impress Head Coach Dale Parker and Staff. Rumor has it, our Chief Marketing Officer and wanna-be GM Bigfoot may make a cameo to help evaluate talent. A 2nd (and final) Open Tryout has been scheduled for Saturday, April 3rd. Interested players can get more information and register at appalachianfc.com as the team will start to prepare for the inaugural NPSL Season in May. #Believe2021</p>
