 <h2>The Build Up</h2>
<p>This match was the home opener for the 2024 season and it really got things going for App FC.  Some great performances from Vincent Montoya, Charlie Leech, Elie Bokota, and Niall Reid-Stephens capped off a great night at the Ted Mack.</p>
<p>There was a quite a crowd for the traveling team that came up from Hickory for the match. This is there first season as a club and they'd played a weekend match against Apotheos FC on May 4th which they won 2-0 and put them top of the league with that one match played.</p>
<p>Feels like a long time since the 2023 season and the Boone fans including the always great Squatch Guard were looking forward to the match.</p>
<h2>The Match</h2>
<p>Things started off pretty well for App FC who applied great pressure high up the pitch and made it hard for Hickory to get out of their own half.  Every time they tried to go long the returning defenders Rashawn Kellman and Grey Smith mopped things up.  </p>
<p>In the first five minutes there was an open net situation when Charlie Walker came out to challenge Hickory FC's number 18.  The Hickory forward was unable to get the ball on target however.</p>
<p>In the twentieth minute Rashawn Kellmand scored the first goal of the season from an Adam Yousfi free kick.  The free kick was earned by Reid-Stephens after dispossing Hickory almost by the corner flag.</p>
<p>The second goal came from Niall Reid-Stephens from well outside the box.  Just to the left of center beyond the D he blasted one into the bottom left corner for 2-0 Appalachian FC.</p>
<p>The first half finished out with Hickory FC having some spells of possesion and trying to get a clear chance on goal.  </p>
<p>The second half was back and forth with App FC pressuring the Hickory goal and Hickory getting more possession than in the first half.</p>
<p>Being a friendly there were quite a few substitutions and it was great to get a look at the whole team during the first match of the season. New to App FC Ken Raghoebar had some great defending throughout the match.</p>
<p>Returning player Tomas De Graauw came on in the second half and really shown with his pressing, passing, and defending. App FC had several shots saved and a couple wide of the target, but in the 91st minute Oskar Ilhen chipped the keeper to make it 3-0 to Appalachian FC right before the final wistle.</p>
